## About the Collection

This is a collection of digitized telegrams sent to Dolly Pinfrock Ballard the week of November 6, 1936. The telegrams were all sent in response to the murder of her husband: **Charles Edward "Ed" Ballard.**

## About Ed Ballard

Ed Ballard was born in 1874, just outside of French Lick, in the small town of Hillham, Indiana. Little is known about his early life, but his ascent to wealth was "rapid," according to an article published shortly after his death in the *Indianapolis Star*.<sup>1</sup> According to Ballard's son, Chad, he only had an education up to the fourth grade, when he quit to be a pinsetter for the bowling alley in the West Baden Springs Hotel. At sixteen, he became a rural mail carrier, and by the time he was 19, he became a bartender in the nearby town of Paoli. Here, he had his first foray into running games of chance.<sup>2</sup>

By 1903, the *Inter Ocean*, a Chicago newspaper, called Ballard the "King of the West Baden Sporting Fraternity" and was the manager of the casino located on thegrounds of the West Baden Springs Hotel.<sup>3</sup>
